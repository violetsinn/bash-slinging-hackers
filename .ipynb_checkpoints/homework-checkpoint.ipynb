    "## This Assignment\n",
    "In this homework, you will use what you've learned in class to create a classifier that can distinguish spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails. In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n",

    "After this homework, you should feel comfortable with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature engineering with text data\n",
    "- Using sklearn libraries to process data and fit models\n",
    "- Validating the performance of your model and minimize overfitting\n",
    "- Generating and analyzing precision recall curves\n",

    "We've tried our best to filter the data for anything blatantly offensive as best as we can, but unfortunately there may still be some examples you may find in poor taste. If you encounter these examples and believe it is inappropriate for students, please let a TA know and we will try to remove it for future semesters. Thanks for your understanding!\n",

    "When the feature is binary, it makes sense (as in the previous question) to compare the proportion of 1s in the two classes of email. Otherwise, if the feature can take on many values, it makes sense to compare the distribution under spam to the distribution under ham. Create a *class conditional density plot* like the one below (which was created using `sns.distplot`), comparing the distribution of a feature among all spam emails to the distribution of the same feature among all ham emails. You should use your training set (after splitting). **You may use the length of the email body or create your own feature.** If using length of the email body, please set the xlim to 50000.\n",

    "1. I expanded the histogram from Question 3a and tested it on words that a Google search revealed were common in spam. I also examined some of the spam emails from the training set to get a sense of which words should be included.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. I tried a lot of words that were common in spam emails overall, but that seemed not to appear in our training or test set, potentially because they had been filtered out by staff. I also initially had a list of over 20 words but my test set results were lower than expected because they may have been overfitting to the training set. The model worked better when I limited myself to fewer words that occured more frequently in spam than ham. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. I was surprised by some of the words that ended up on my final list, like 'guaranteed' and 'remove' which didn't seem spammy in and of themselves. However, I came to notice that absolutist language was more prevalent in spam emails which explained why these terms appeared."

    "I plotted a correlation matrix for some of the words I thought would be found more in spam than ham. I used this visualization to help me decide which words would be included in my final model. I already knew that these words were used more frequently in spam emails than ham emails from the histogram in 3a, however, I wanted to make sure that all these words were not coming from the same emails. For example, you can see in the correlation matrix that the words \"spam\" and \"remove\" are correlated with each other, indicating that whenever the word \"spam\" is used the word \"remove\" is also used. If this is true, then including both words in the model is a bit pointless, as the model could have caught the spam with just one of the words. I therefore looked for words with low correlation that appeared frequently in spam emails to ensure that I caught as many as possible."

    "# Question 9 (Making a Precision-Recall Curve)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can trade off between precision and recall. In most cases we won't be able to get both perfect precision (i.e. no false positives) and recall (i.e. no false negatives), so we have to compromise. For example, in the case of cancer screenings, false negatives are comparatively worse than false positives — a false negative means that a patient might not discover a disease until it's too late to treat, while a false positive means that a patient will probably have to take another screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that logistic regression calculates the probability that an example belongs to a certain class. Then, to classify an example we say that an email is spam if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.5$ probability of being spam. However, *we can adjust that cutoff*: we can say that an email is spam only if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.7$ probability of being spam, for example. This is how we can trade off false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The precision-recall curve shows this trade off for each possible cutoff probability. In the cell below, [plot a precision-recall curve](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_precision_recall.html#plot-the-precision-recall-curve) for your final classifier (the one you use to make predictions for Kaggle)."
